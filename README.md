# Basic-Prosthetic-Hand

Uses Myoware EMG sensor to read muscle movement and simulate gripping. Linear actuators move rigid links to close and open hand
  * Linear actuators are used here, but could also use servos or linear solenoids
  * Hand opens and closes based on whether EMG value passes a hardcoded threshold
  * Power supply needs to be fixed/tested more
