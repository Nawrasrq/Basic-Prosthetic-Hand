# Basic-Prosthetic-Hand

Code to use Myoware EMG sensor to read muscle movement and simulate gripping. Linear actuators would move rigid links to close and open hand
  * Hand opens and closes based on whether EMG value passes a hardcoded threshold
  * Lacks mechanical model and implementation (Prosthetic hand wasn't built, only the electrical components and software)
  * Linear actuators are listed, but could also use servos or linear solenoids
  * Power supply needs to be fixed/tested more
